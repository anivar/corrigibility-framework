# Contributing

Contributions to the Corrigibility Framework are welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. System Assessments

Evaluate a system against the five tests and submit an assessment.

**Requirements:**
- Use the `corrigibility.json` schema
- Provide evidence for each test result
- Include methodology link or description
- Be specific about what was evaluated and when

**Process:**
1. Fork this repository
2. Create assessment file in `assessments/[system-name]-assessment.json`
3. Submit pull request with description of methodology

### 2. Schema Improvements

Propose changes to `infrastructure.json` or `corrigibility.json`.

**Process:**
1. Open an issue describing the proposed change
2. Explain rationale and backward compatibility implications
3. If accepted, submit pull request

### 3. Tools

Build validators, diff tools, dashboards, or other utilities.

**Guidelines:**
- Tools should work with the schema as published
- Include tests
- Document usage

### 4. Documentation

Improve methodology guides, translations, or examples.

## Assessment Guidelines

When submitting an assessment:

1. **Be specific**: Name the exact system, version, and date assessed
2. **Cite evidence**: Link to sources (documentation, RTI responses, published audits)
3. **Acknowledge limitations**: Note what you could not verify
4. **Disclose conflicts**: Note any affiliation with the system operator

## Code of Conduct

- Assessments should be factual, not adversarial
- Critique structures, not individuals
- Respect that operators may dispute findings
- Multiple assessments of the same system may coexist
